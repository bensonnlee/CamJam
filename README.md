# 📸 CamJam

**CamJam** is a React Native mobile app built for seamless group photo sharing during events. Whether you're organizing a concert, a birthday, or a last-minute beach hangout, CamJam lets you create or join a shared photo space with just an access code — no hassle, no clutter.

Built as part of a group, CamJam is focused on **simplicity, security, and spontaneity**. Snap a moment, and it’s instantly shared with your group — and automatically cleaned up after the event is over.

## 🎯 Why CamJam?
